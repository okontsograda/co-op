# Character System Changes Summary

## 🔧 Code Changes Made

### 1. Updated `coop/scripts/player_class.gd`

**Added sprite_frames_path to each class:**
```gdscript
"knight": {
    "name": "Knight",
    "sprite_frames_path": "res://assets/Characters/Knight/knight_sprite_frames.tres",
    "health_modifier": 1.5,
    "damage_modifier": 1.3,
    "speed_modifier": 0.8,
    // ...
}
```

**Changes:**
- Added `sprite_frames_path` property to all 4 classes
- Changed color_tint from colored to `Color.WHITE` (no tint on base sprites)
- Renamed "warrior" class to "knight" for better clarity
- Each character now points to its own SpriteFrames resource

### 2. Updated `coop/scripts/player.gd`

**Modified `apply_class_modifiers()` function:**
```gdscript
func apply_class_modifiers(selected_class: String) -> void:
    var class_data = PlayerClass.get_class_by_name(selected_class)
    
    // ... existing stat modifiers ...
    
    # NEW: Load and apply character sprite frames
    var animated_sprite = get_node_or_null("AnimatedSprite2D")
    if animated_sprite and class_data.has("sprite_frames_path"):
        var sprite_frames = load(class_data["sprite_frames_path"])
        if sprite_frames:
            animated_sprite.sprite_frames = sprite_frames
            # Restart animation with new sprite
            if animated_sprite.is_playing():
                var current_anim = animated_sprite.animation
                animated_sprite.play(current_anim)
```

**What it does:**
- Loads the SpriteFrames resource specified in the class data
- Applies it to the player's AnimatedSprite2D
- Restarts current animation so changes are visible immediately
- Falls back gracefully if sprite frames are missing

## 🎮 How It Works Now

### Before (Old System):
1. Player selects class in lobby
2. All classes use same Archer sprites
3. Color tint applied to differentiate classes
4. Result: All characters look the same (just different colors)

### After (New System):
1. Player selects class in lobby
2. Class selection includes sprite_frames_path
3. When game starts, `apply_class_modifiers()` runs
4. Function loads character-specific SpriteFrames
5. Player spawns with correct character sprites
6. Result: Each class has unique visual appearance!

## 🔄 Animation Flow

```
Player Spawns
    ↓
_ready() called
    ↓
apply_class_modifiers(selected_class) called
    ↓
Load sprite_frames from path in PlayerClass
    ↓
Apply to AnimatedSprite2D
    ↓
Player renders with correct character sprites
    ↓
Animation system works normally:
    - idle animation when standing
    - walk animation when moving
    - fire animation when attacking
```

---

## ✅ What Works Automatically

- **Multiplayer sync**: Sprite frames are loaded locally on each client
- **Animation system**: Existing animation code (idle/walk/fire) works unchanged
- **Lobby selection**: Class selection UI works with new Knight class
- **Stats system**: Health/damage/speed modifiers still apply correctly

---

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### SpriteFrames Resource (.tres file)

This is a Godot resource that contains:
- Multiple animations (idle, walk, fire)
- Frame-by-frame textures for each animation
- Animation speed (FPS)
- Loop settings
- All configuration for AnimatedSprite2D

**Why use SpriteFrames?**
- Clean separation of sprite data from code
- Easy to edit animations in Godot editor
- Can be loaded dynamically at runtime
- Supports frame-by-frame animation
- Better performance than switching textures manually

### Resource Loading

```gdscript
var sprite_frames = load(class_data["sprite_frames_path"])
```

- `load()` is a built-in Godot function
- Loads resources from file path at runtime
- Cached automatically by Godot (no duplicate loading)
- Works in exported builds (resources are packed)

## 🐛 Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to load sprite frames"
**Cause**: Path in player_class.gd doesn't match actual file location
**Solution**: 
- Verify file exists at specified path
- Check spelling and capitalization
- Path should be relative to project root: `res://...`

### Issue: Animations don't play
**Cause**: Animation names don't match expected names
**Solution**: 
- Ensure animations are named exactly: `idle`, `walk`, `fire`
- Check animation exists in SpriteFrames editor
- Verify Loop is enabled

### Issue: Character appears as white box
**Cause**: SpriteFrames has no frames or missing textures
**Solution**:
- Open SpriteFrames in editor
- Verify each animation has frames
- Check that PNG files are in correct folder

## 🎯 Class Stat Summary

| Class  | Health | Damage | Speed | Attack Speed | Role        |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Archer | 100    | 15     | 100%  | 100%         | Balanced    |
| Knight | 150    | 20     | 80%   | 90%          | Tank/Melee  |
| Mage   | 70     | 23     | 100%  | 140%         | Glass Cannon|
| Tank   | 200    | 12     | 70%   | 100%         | Defender    |

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up Archer sprites in new folder structure
2. **Next**: Find and import Knight sprite sheets
3. **Then**: Create knight_sprite_frames.tres
4. **Test**: Verify both Archer and Knight work in-game
5. **Later**: Add Mage and Tank sprites (same process)

## 💡 Tips for Finding Sprite Sheets

**Search terms:**
- "knight sprite sheet pixel art"
- "medieval character sprite sheet"
- "2d knight animation sprite"
- "top down knight sprite"

**Recommended sites:**
- itch.io/game-assets (filter: free, sprites)
- opengameart.org
- craftpix.net/freebies
- kenney.nl

**What to look for:**
- License: Free for commercial use
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Layout: Horizontal sprite sheet
- Animations: At minimum idle, walk, attack
- Style: Matches your archer's pixel art style

## ✨ Benefits of This System

1. **Scalable**: Easy to add more characters
2. **Organized**: Each character has its own folder
3. **Maintainable**: Change sprites without touching code
4. **Flexible**: Can mix and match animations
5. **Professional**: Standard game development practice
6. **Multiplayer-safe**: Works automatically across network
