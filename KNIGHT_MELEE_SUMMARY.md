# 🗡️ Knight Melee Combat - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

The knight character now has **full melee combat** instead of shooting arrows. When playing as knight, clicking attacks enemies within sword range.

---

## 🔧 Code Changes

### 1. Updated `PlayerClass` System (`player_class.gd`)

Added two new properties to all classes:
- **`combat_type`**: "ranged" or "melee"
- **`attack_range`**: Melee reach in pixels (0 for ranged = unlimited)

```gdscript
"knight": {
    "combat_type": "melee",     # ← NEW: Enables melee
    "attack_range": 60.0,       # ← NEW: Sword reach
    // ... other stats
}
```

### 2. Updated `Player` Script (`player.gd`)

**Added Variables:**
```gdscript
var combat_type: String = "ranged"
var melee_attack_range: float = 60.0
```

**Added Functions:**
- `handle_melee_attack()` - Handles knight's sword attacks
- `perform_melee_damage()` - Damages enemies in cone range
- `perform_melee_damage_network()` [RPC] - Syncs attacks to other players
- `spawn_damage_number()` - Shows damage above enemies

**Modified Functions:**
- `handle_fire_action()` - Now checks combat type and routes to melee or ranged
- `apply_class_modifiers()` - Loads combat type from class data

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### Melee Attack Process

```
1. Player clicks mouse
2. Check combat_type == "melee"
3. Play sword swing animation
4. After 0.3s delay (mid-swing)
5. Find all enemies within 60 pixels
6. Check if enemies are in front of player (~60° cone)
7. Damage all enemies in range & direction
8. Apply critical hits, lifesteal, etc.
9. Sync to other clients via RPC
```

### Attack Cone

```
        Enemy A (hit ✓)
           ↑
      60° cone
         ↗ ↑ ↖
       KNIGHT → mouse direction
         ↘   ↙
     Enemy B      Enemy C
     (hit ✓)      (missed ✗ - behind)
```

Knight attacks in a forward cone. Enemies behind or far to sides won't be hit.

## 📊 Stats & Balance

### Knight vs Archer

| Stat | Archer | Knight |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Combat Type** | Ranged | Melee |
| **Attack Range** | Unlimited | 60 pixels |
| **Health** | 100 | 150 (+50%) |
| **Damage** | 15 | 20 (+33%) |
| **Speed** | 100% | 80% (-20%) |
| **Attack Speed** | 100% | 90% (-10%) |

### Knight Strengths
- ✅ High health (can tank)
- ✅ High damage per hit
- ✅ Hits multiple enemies at once
- ✅ Instant damage (no projectile travel)
- ✅ Great with lifesteal upgrades

### Knight Weaknesses
- ❌ Must get close to enemies
- ❌ Vulnerable while approaching
- ❌ Slower movement
- ❌ Limited range

---

## 🔥 Combat Features

### Multi-Target Attacks
Knight can hit **multiple enemies** in one swing if they're grouped together within the 60 pixel cone.

### Critical Hits
Works with weapon_stats.crit_chance just like ranged weapons.

### Lifesteal
Heals per enemy hit - very powerful when hitting multiple enemies!

### Damage Numbers
Visual feedback shows damage dealt above each enemy hit.

### Network Sync
All attacks properly synced across multiplayer - other players see your swings.

---

## 🎯 Upgrade Compatibility

### Works with Melee ✅
- Damage Boost
- Critical Chance
- Critical Multiplier
- Lifesteal
- Attack Speed / Fire Rate
- Damage Shield

### Doesn't Apply ❌
- Pierce (projectiles only)
- Multishot (projectiles only)
- Arrow Speed (projectiles only)
- Homing (projectiles only)
- Explosive Arrows (projectiles only)
- Poison Arrows (projectiles only)

---

## 🌐 Multiplayer

### Host/Client Behavior
- **Local player**: Performs attack immediately, calculates damage
- **RPC sent**: Other clients notified of attack
- **Other clients**: Play animation, sound, and calculate damage
- **Result**: Everyone sees the same attack happen

### Network Functions
- `perform_melee_damage_network()` - Syncs melee attacks
- Same network reliability as arrow spawning
- Works in both host and client roles

---

## 🎨 Animation

Uses the existing **"fire"** animation:
- Archer: Bow shooting animation
- Knight: Sword swing animation

Both use the same animation name but different sprite frames (loaded from SpriteFrames resource).

---

## 🎵 Audio

Uses the weapon sound system:
- Plays on attack start
- Synced across network
- Can be customized per weapon in WeaponData

## 🧪 Testing

### What to Test

1. **Basic Attack**
   - [ ] Knight swings sword (no arrows)
   - [ ] Enemies take damage
   - [ ] Damage numbers appear

2. **Range Check**
   - [ ] Enemies beyond 60 pixels aren't hit
   - [ ] Enemies within range are hit
   - [ ] Can't attack from safety (must be close)

3. **Direction Check**
   - [ ] Enemies in front are hit
   - [ ] Enemies behind aren't hit
   - [ ] Player faces mouse cursor

4. **Multi-Target**
   - [ ] Can hit multiple enemies at once
   - [ ] Each enemy takes damage
   - [ ] Multiple damage numbers spawn

5. **Upgrades**
   - [ ] Critical hits work
   - [ ] Lifesteal heals
   - [ ] Damage boosts apply
   - [ ] Attack speed increases swing rate

6. **Multiplayer**
   - [ ] Other players see your attacks
   - [ ] You see other players' attacks
   - [ ] Damage synced correctly
   - [ ] Works as both host and client

7. **Class Switch**
   - [ ] Archer still shoots arrows
   - [ ] Knight does melee
   - [ ] Mage shoots (when added)
   - [ ] Tank shoots (when added)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Knight doesn't attack**
- Check console for "Player X melee attacking!" message
- Verify combat_type is set to "melee"
- Ensure class is applied (check apply_class_modifiers logs)

**No enemies are hit**
- Check enemies are in "enemies" group
- Verify melee_attack_range = 60.0
- Stand closer to enemies
- Face toward enemies

**Still shooting arrows instead of melee**
- Verify player_class.gd has combat_type = "melee" for knight
- Check that class is being selected correctly in lobby
- Restart game after code changes

## 📈 Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- Melee-specific upgrade tree
- Charge attacks
- Combo system
- Knockback effects
- Block/parry mechanic
- Sword trail VFX
- Different melee weapons (sword, axe, spear)

## 🎉 Summary

**Before:**
- All classes shot arrows (just different stats)
- No melee combat
- Limited playstyle variety

**After:**
- Knight has unique melee combat
- Close-range sword attacks
- Hits multiple enemies in cone
- Full upgrade compatibility
- Synced in multiplayer
- Creates distinct playstyles

**Result:** 
Knights play completely differently from archers! Tank-focused, high-damage, close-range combat. Perfect for players who want to be in the thick of battle! 🗡️⚔️

## ✨ Quick Start

1. **Select Knight** in lobby
2. **Click near enemies** to attack
3. **Get close** - melee range is 60 pixels
4. **Face enemies** - attacks in cone in front
5. **Use lifesteal** upgrades - very powerful for melee!

Enjoy your new melee knight! 🛡️⚔️
